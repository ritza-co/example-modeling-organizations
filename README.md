# Example Modeling Organizations Using The FusionAuth Entity Management Feature

This repo holds a companion Node.js Express application called "AwesomeCRM" for the [Modeling Organizations guide](https://fusionauth.io/docs/extend/examples/modeling-organizations) on the FusionAuth website. The guide walks through how to model organizations in FusionAuth using the Entity Management feature.


## Project Contents

The `docker-compose.yml` file and the `kickstart` directory are used to start and configure a local FusionAuth server.

The `/complete-application` directory contains a fully working version of the application.

## Project Dependencies
* Docker, to run FusionAuth
* Node 16 or later, to run the AwesomeCRM Express application

## FusionAuth Installation Via Docker

**NOTE:** Before running the command to install FusionAuth, add your FusionAuth license key to the `./kickstart/kickstart.json` file. Find the `licenseId` field on line 24 and replace the field value with your license key. Please visit [https://fusionauth.io/pricing](https://fusionauth.io/pricing) to read more about FusionAuth licensing.

In the root of this project directory (next to this README) are two files: [a Docker compose file](./docker-compose.yml) and an [environment variables configuration file](./.env). Assuming you have Docker installed on your machine, you can stand up FusionAuth on your machine with the following command.

```shell
docker compose up -d
```

The FusionAuth configuration files use a unique feature of FusionAuth called [Kickstart](https://fusionauth.io/docs/v1/tech/installation-guide/kickstart). When FusionAuth comes up for the first time, it will look at the [Kickstart file](./kickstart/kickstart.json) and mimic API calls to configure FusionAuth for use. 

> **NOTE:** If you ever want to reset the FusionAuth system, delete the volumes created by Docker Compose by executing `docker compose down -v`.

FusionAuth will be configured with these settings:

* Your Client Id is: `e9fdb985-9173-4e01-9d73-ac2d60d1dc8e`
* Your Client Secret is: `super-secret-secret-that-should-be-regenerated-for-production`
* Your example usernames are:
  * `richard@example.com`,  password is `password`. Richard is the admin for the "Pied Piper" entity.
  * `erlich@example.com`,  password is `password`. Erlich is the admin for the "Aviato" entity.
  * `jared@example.com`,  password is `password`. Jared is the admin for the "Hooli" entity.
* Your admin username for FusionAuth is `admin@example.com` and your password is `password`.
* Your `fusionAuthBaseUrl` is `http://localhost:9011/`

You can log in to the [FusionAuth admin UI](http://localhost:9011/admin) and look around if you want to, but with Docker and Kickstart, everything will already be configured correctly.

## Running The Example App

To run the application, first go into the project directory.

```shell
cd complete-application
```

Install dependencies.

```shell
npm install
```

Start the application.

```shell
npm start
```

Browse to the application at http://localhost:3000.
